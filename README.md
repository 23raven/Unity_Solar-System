## Notes on the Course

The course itself is well-structured and high quality. The content is clear, practical, and enjoyable to work through, especially for beginners in game development.

However, the payment and subscription system on Coursera felt confusing and insufficiently transparent. Because of this lack of clarity around billing and subscriptions, I decided not to continue learning on the platform despite the strong course material.
